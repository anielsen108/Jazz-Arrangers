Frank Benjamin Foster III was born in Cincinnati and became one of the most important arrangers in the Count Basie tradition. He played tenor saxophone with Count Basie's orchestra from 1953 to 1964, contributing numerous arrangements that became band signatures. After leaving Basie, Foster led his own groups, worked as freelance arranger, and eventually led the Count Basie Orchestra from 1986 to 1995 after Basie's death. His compositions including "Shiny Stockings," "Simone," and "Down for the Count" became jazz standards. Foster received NEA Jazz Master honor and continued performing and arranging until shortly before his death. His arranging maintained Kansas City blues traditions while incorporating modern harmonic and rhythmic elements. Foster's work demonstrated that swing traditions could remain vital and relevant, not merely nostalgic, through thoughtful modernization.

His voicings were clear and powerful, emphasizing the brass strength that characterized Kansas City big band tradition. Foster understood how to write for blues feeling while maintaining sophisticated harmonic movement. His arrangements balanced simplicity and complexity, never losing swing feeling amid harmonic sophistication.
