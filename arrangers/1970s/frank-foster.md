He later led the Basie orchestra after Basie's death. Foster's arranging style maintained Kansas City blues tradition while incorporating modern elements. His compositions like "Shiny Stockings" became standards. Foster's work represented the continuation of Basie's legacy, demonstrating that swing traditions remained vital.
