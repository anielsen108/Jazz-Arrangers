# Louie Bellson (1924-2009)

Luigi Paulino Alfredo Francesco Antonio Balassoni, known as Louie Bellson, was born in Illinois and became one of jazz's greatest drummers while leading his own big bands. He arranged for his ensembles while playing with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and others. Bellson's arrangements featured exciting drumming showcases combined with sophisticated ensemble writing. His style maintained big band traditions while incorporating modern elements. Bellson's work demonstrated that drummer-leaders could create substantial arrangements, not just vehicles for drum solos.
