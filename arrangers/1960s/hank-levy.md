# Hank Levy (1927-2001)

## Biography

Hank Levy was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and became renowned for sophisticated arrangements in complex time signatures. He studied at Peabody Conservatory before serving in the Army, where he began serious arranging. Levy worked with Stan Kenton's orchestra in the 1960s and 1970s, providing numerous arrangements in odd meters that became Kenton signatures. He also arranged extensively for Don Ellis, whose orchestra specialized in unusual time signatures and polyrhythmic structures. Beyond professional arranging, Levy taught at Towson University for over 30 years, influencing generations of arrangers and composers. His compositions including "Whiplash" (in 7/4), "Decoupage" (in 5/4), and "Chiapas" (in 3/4 and 7/8) became modern jazz standards. Levy's work demonstrated that complex meters could groove and swing, influencing progressive jazz and contemporary arranging. His dedication to education ensured his concepts reached beyond his own work into the next generation.

## Musical Style

Levy's arranging style featured mathematical precision combined with genuine swing feeling, demonstrating that complex meters could groove as hard as 4/4. His arrangements in odd time signatures (5/4, 7/4, 7/8, and more complex divisions) never felt academic or stiff—Levy understood how to create natural phrasing within unusual metric frameworks. His voicings were modern and colorful, often featuring clusters and quartal harmonies that complemented the metric complexity. What made Levy's work distinctive was his ability to make odd meters feel inevitable rather than imposed—his melodic and rhythmic phrasing worked with the meters rather than against them. Levy wrote excellently for big band, understanding how to create clarity in complex textures. His arrangements challenged musicians technically while remaining musical rather than merely difficult. Levy's style represented intellectual rigor serving musical expression, proving that complexity and accessibility could coexist.

## Top Albums

### Stan Kenton - "Live at Redlands University" (1970)
Levy's arrangements for Kenton's orchestra showcase his mastery of odd meters in live performance. His charts including "Chiapas" demonstrate that complex time signatures could work in concert settings, maintaining audience engagement while challenging musicians. What makes these arrangements remarkable is their energy—Levy's 7/8 and 5/4 charts swing hard, proving that odd meters weren't merely intellectual exercises. His orchestration is colorful and dynamic, using Kenton's powerful brass sections effectively. The arrangements show Levy's gift for creating exciting, danceable music in seemingly undanceable meters.

### Don Ellis Orchestra - "Tears of Joy" (1971)
Levy's arrangements for Ellis's progressive big band push metric complexity even further. His charts feature shifting meters, polyrhythms, and complex metric modulations that would seem impossible to swing—yet they groove intensely. What's particularly impressive is Levy's collaboration with Ellis in developing arranging techniques for extreme metric complexity. His arrangement of "Strawberry Soup" demonstrates his mastery of metric superimposition and his understanding of how to maintain forward motion through constant metric shifts. The work represents the apex of odd-meter big band arranging.

### Stan Kenton - "Journey Into Capricorn" (1976)
Levy's later arrangements for Kenton show continued evolution in his approach to complex meters. His charts maintain his signature odd-meter sophistication while incorporating contemporary harmonic colors. What makes these arrangements fascinating is their maturity—Levy's decades of experience result in arrangements of remarkable economy and effectiveness. His "Decoupage" remains one of the most successful odd-meter charts in jazz, with its 5/4 meter feeling completely natural. The album demonstrates that Levy remained vital and innovative throughout his career, continually finding new possibilities in metric complexity.
