# Don Ellis (1934-1978)

## Biography

Donald Johnson Ellis was born in Los Angeles and studied at Boston University. He played trumpet with various bands before forming his own innovative big band in 1965. Ellis pioneered the use of odd time signatures (7/4, 19/4, 27/16) in big band jazz, incorporating Indian rhythms, electronic instruments, and amplification. His orchestra featured an expanded brass section with multiple trumpets. Ellis won Grammy Awards and influenced fusion and progressive jazz significantly. He died young from heart disease but left a legacy of innovation. Ellis's fearless experimentation demonstrated that big band jazz could embrace radical new concepts while maintaining excitement and swing.

## Musical Style

Ellis's arranging style was revolutionary, incorporating complex odd-meter rhythms, electronic instruments, and amplified sound. His arrangements featured intricate polyrhythms often derived from Indian classical music. Ellis had a gift for making extremely complex material swing and groove—his charts in 19/4 or 33/16 were nonetheless danceable. His orchestrations incorporated rock and electronic elements ahead of their time. Ellis used ring modulators, Fender Rhodes, and electric bass in big band contexts before fusion became common. His arrangements were technically demanding, requiring virtuoso musicians, but never lost emotional impact. Ellis's style emphasized excitement and innovation, demonstrating that intellectual complexity and visceral power could coexist. His work influenced progressive jazz, fusion, and contemporary big band music.
