David Amram was born in Philadelphia and became one of America's most versatile composer-arrangers, working across jazz, classical, world music, and film.

Amram remained remarkably productive into his 90s, composing, performing, and conducting internationally. His eclectic approach demonstrates that arrangers can work across multiple genres while maintaining artistic integrity and a distinctive voice.
