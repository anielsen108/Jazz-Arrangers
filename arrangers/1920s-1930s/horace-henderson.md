# Horace Henderson (1904-1988)

## Biography

Horace W. Henderson, younger brother of Fletcher Henderson, was born in Cuthbert, Georgia. Like his brother, he studied at Atlanta University and was trained as a classical pianist. Horace led his own groups starting in the late 1920s and arranged for his brother's orchestra, becoming one of Fletcher's most important arrangers. He also wrote arrangements for Benny Goodman, the Casa Loma Orchestra, Charlie Barnet, and many others. His composition "Big John Special" became a swing standard. After the big band era, Henderson continued playing and arranging, though he never achieved the recognition his contributions deserved. He remained active in music into the 1980s.

## Musical Style

Horace Henderson's arranging style was similar to his brother Fletcher's but with more adventurous harmonies and a slightly more aggressive edge. He had a gift for writing exciting, hard-swinging arrangements that featured powerful brass sections and intricate reed passages. Henderson's arrangements often built tension through rhythmic displacement and unexpected harmonic turns. He was particularly skilled at creating dramatic contrasts between sections—soft intimate passages followed by explosive ensemble playing. His riff-based arrangements influenced the Kansas City style, though Henderson worked primarily in New York. He had strong classical training that informed his sophisticated harmonic choices, but he never let compositional complexity interfere with swing feeling. Henderson's arrangements gave soloists excellent frameworks while maintaining strong arranged material.

### Fletcher Henderson Orchestra - "The Fletcher Henderson Story, Vol. 3" (1934-1936, Horace Henderson arrangements)
Horace's arrangements for his brother's orchestra include some of the band's finest recordings. "Big John Special," "Hot and Anxious," and "Christopher Columbus" demonstrate his gift for creating infectious, hard-driving swing arrangements. What's particularly notable is how Horace's arrangements energized Fletcher's band during a period when they faced financial struggles—these charts show no compromise in musical ambition. "Christopher Columbus" became one of the era's biggest hits and showcases Horace's ability to create memorable riffs that built into exciting climaxes.

### Benny Goodman Orchestra - "The Complete RCA Victor Small Group Recordings" (featuring Henderson arrangements)
Horace arranged several pieces for Goodman, including "Dear Old Southland" which demonstrates his ability to write in various styles from hot swing to sensitive ballads. What's interesting is how Horace adapted his style for Goodman's band while maintaining his identity—the arrangements swing hard in the Goodman manner but retain Henderson's harmonic sophistication. His work for Goodman gave him wider exposure than his brother Fletcher's band could provide, though Horace remained less famous than his elder sibling.

### Charlie Barnet Orchestra - "Cherokee" (1939-1942, Henderson arrangements)
Horace's arrangements for the progressive Barnet orchestra show him embracing a more modern harmonic approach. His charts helped Barnet's band develop its distinctive sound, more adventurous than most swing bands. What makes these arrangements fascinating is hearing how Horace evolved beyond traditional swing to anticipate bebop harmonies. He was willing to take risks with dissonance and unusual voicings that more conservative arrangers avoided. These arrangements demonstrate that Horace was thinking ahead to jazz's next evolution.
