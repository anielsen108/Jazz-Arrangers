# Benny Carter (1907-2003)

## Biography

Born in New York City, Bennett Lester Carter taught himself to play trumpet and several other instruments before settling on alto saxophone and arranging. He joined Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in 1930, where he contributed many arrangements before becoming Henderson's de facto musical director. Carter led his own big band intermittently throughout the 1930s and spent 1935-1938 in Europe, where he was hailed as royalty and arranged for the BBC and various European orchestras. Returning to the U.S., he moved to California in 1942 and became one of the first African Americans to work regularly as a composer and arranger in Hollywood, while continuing his jazz career for six more decades.

## Musical Style

Carter's arranging was characterized by elegance, clarity, and impeccable craftsmanship. His reed section writing set the standard for all who followed—he created lush, harmonically rich saxophone section passages that moved with liquid grace. Carter had a particular genius for voicing chords in the mid-range, creating a warm, blended sound that became his trademark. His arrangements balanced complexity with accessibility, featuring sophisticated harmonies that never obscured the melodic line. He was one of the first arrangers to write truly independent and interesting lines for all sections simultaneously. Carter's style remained remarkably consistent throughout his long career, maintaining a timeless quality that was modern in 1930 and still sounded fresh in the 1990s.

## Top Albums

### Benny Carter and His Orchestra - "Symphonically Yours" (1939-1940)
These arrangements showcase Carter at his peak as an arranger-leader, with lush reed section writing on tracks like "Melancholy Lullaby" and swinging charts like "All of Me." What's particularly interesting is how Carter integrates string section writing (unusual for swing bands) without losing the jazz feeling. His alto saxophone solos seamlessly emerge from and return to the arranged passages, demonstrating perfect unity between soloist and arranger. The arrangements have aged remarkably well, sounding as fresh today as they did in 1940.

### Benny Carter - "Further Definitions" (1961)
Recording with Coleman Hawkins and a saxophone section featuring Phil Woods and Charlie Rouse, Carter revisited his 1937 arrangements with updated harmonies. What makes this album fascinating is hearing how Carter's arranging concepts translated to the modern jazz era—the core ideas of blend, balance, and melodic clarity remained timeless. The saxophone section writing on "Body and Soul" and "Honeysuckle Rose" demonstrates why Carter was called "The King" of alto and arranging. The interplay between the arranged passages and the solos shows Carter's gift for creating arrangements that enhance rather than constrain improvisation.

### Benny Carter - "Over the Rainbow" (1980)
Recorded when Carter was 73, this album proves his arranging skills remained sharp. Working with a big band and his American Jazz Orchestra, Carter's arrangements balance swing era vitality with modern harmonic sensibilities. What's remarkable is the continuity in Carter's style—these arrangements could have been written in 1940 or 1980, yet they sound contemporary in both eras. The title track demonstrates his gift for reimagining standards with fresh voicings while respecting the original melody, a hallmark of his arranging philosophy.
