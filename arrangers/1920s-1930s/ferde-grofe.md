# Ferde Grofé (1892-1972)

## Biography

Ferdinand Rudolph von Grofé was born in New York City into a musical family. He worked as a pianist in various contexts before joining Paul Whiteman's orchestra as pianist and chief arranger in 1920. Grofé's most famous work was his orchestration of George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" for Whiteman's 1924 "Experiment in Modern Music" concert. He created elaborate symphonic arrangements of popular songs and jazz pieces, helping to define "symphonic jazz." After leaving Whiteman in 1933, Grofé composed symphonic suites including "Grand Canyon Suite" and "Mississippi Suite" that blended classical forms with American vernacular music. He continued composing and arranging until his death.

## Musical Style

Grofé's arranging style was characterized by symphonic scope and classical orchestration techniques applied to jazz and popular materials. He used the full orchestra palette—strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion—to create impressionistic tone poems and coloristic arrangements. His work emphasized timbre and texture, often using unusual instruments to create specific effects. Grofé was less concerned with swing feeling than with creating sophisticated, through-composed arrangements that elevated popular music to concert hall respectability. His arrangements featured dramatic dynamic contrasts, programmatic elements, and careful attention to orchestral balance. While criticized by some jazz purists for diluting jazz's spontaneity, Grofé's work introduced jazz elements to classical audiences and classical sophistication to popular music. His orchestrations were always impeccably crafted with professional polish.

## Top Albums

### Paul Whiteman Orchestra - "Rhapsody in Blue" (Grofé orchestration, 1927)
Grofé's orchestration of Gershwin's piano concerto became the standard version, and this 1927 recording with Whiteman conducting demonstrates why. Grofé created an orchestral framework that enhanced Gershwin's composition while maintaining its jazz character. What's remarkable is how Grofé balanced the piano soloist with the orchestra, creating dialogue rather than mere accompaniment. His use of the orchestra's full palette—from delicate woodwind passages to powerful brass climaxes—showed jazz could work in symphonic contexts. This arrangement influenced countless attempts to fuse jazz and classical music and remains definitive nearly a century later.

### Ferde Grofé - "Grand Canyon Suite" (1931)
While not strictly jazz, this orchestral suite demonstrates Grofé's arranging genius applied to American programmatic music. The five movements depict different aspects of the Grand Canyon using innovative orchestration—"Cloudburst" features a remarkable percussion section representing a thunderstorm. What's interesting is how Grofé incorporated jazz elements (blue notes, syncopation, walking bass lines) within a classical framework. The suite shows his ability to create vivid musical pictures through orchestration, a skill he also applied to his jazz arrangements. This work influenced American film composers and demonstrated that American concert music could have its own character distinct from European models.

### Paul Whiteman Orchestra - "Symphonic Jazz" (1924-1930)
This collection features Grofé's symphonic jazz arrangements including "Grand Fantasia on American Folk Songs" and elaborate treatments of popular songs. What makes these recordings fascinating is hearing Grofé's attempt to create a middle ground between jazz and classical music—arrangements sophisticated enough for concert halls but retaining jazz's energy. His arrangement of "Ol' Man River" demonstrates his gift for expanding a simple song into an orchestral showpiece. These recordings document an important moment when jazz was seeking legitimacy, and Grofé's sophisticated arrangements helped jazz gain acceptance in prestigious venues.
