# Fletcher Henderson (1897-1952)

## Biography

Born in Cuthbert, Georgia, Fletcher Hamilton Henderson Jr. studied chemistry and mathematics at Atlanta University before moving to New York in 1920 to pursue graduate studies. Instead, he fell into the music business, working as a song demonstrator and recording manager for Black Swan Records. In 1924, he formed his own orchestra at the Roseland Ballroom, which became one of the most influential big bands in jazz history. Though his business ventures were often unsuccessful, Henderson's arrangements—especially those he sold to Benny Goodman in the 1930s—defined the swing era. He continued arranging until suffering a stroke in 1950.

## Musical Style

Henderson's arranging style evolved from the simpler stock arrangements of early jazz to sophisticated swing orchestrations. His mature style featured powerful brass backgrounds, fluid reed section passages, and dynamic contrasts between full ensemble sections and small group interludes. Henderson perfected the art of the "shout chorus"—the climactic final ensemble passage that brought dancers to their feet. His arrangements had a particular quality of relaxed swing, never sounding forced or mechanical. He excelled at writing for the blues and developed techniques for modulating between keys that created dramatic momentum. Henderson's work for Goodman in the mid-1930s essentially launched the Swing Era, with arrangements like "King Porter Stomp" and "Sometimes I'm Happy" becoming templates for big band arranging.

## Top Albums

### Fletcher Henderson and His Orchestra - "The Fletcher Henderson Story: A Study in Frustration" (1923-1938)
This four-disc compilation is essential for understanding the development of swing arranging. Henderson's arrangements featuring Louis Armstrong (1924-1925) show how he learned to write for virtuoso soloists, while his mid-1930s work displays his mature style. What's fascinating is tracking how Henderson absorbed influences from his arrangers (Don Redman, Benny Carter) and synthesized them into his own voice. The recordings from 1932-1934, just before he began supplying Goodman with arrangements, represent some of his finest work.

### Fletcher Henderson - "Tidal Wave" (1931-1934)
This collection captures Henderson's orchestra at its peak, with arrangements that showcase his gift for creating excitement and momentum. "Yeah Man" and "Wrappin' It Up" demonstrate his ability to build arrangement intensity through careful pacing and strategic use of the full ensemble. What makes these recordings particularly interesting is the interplay between arranged sections and solos by stars like Coleman Hawkins and Roy Eldridge—Henderson knew exactly when to write and when to let his soloists shine.

### Benny Goodman - "The Birth of Swing" (1935-1936, Henderson arrangements)
While technically Goodman's recordings, this album showcases Henderson's most influential arrangements, including "King Porter Stomp," "Blue Skies," and "Sometimes I'm Happy." What's remarkable is how Henderson adapted his charts for Goodman's band while maintaining their essential character. These arrangements launched the Swing Era and made Goodman famous, though Henderson remained in financial difficulty. The recordings demonstrate Henderson's genius for creating accessible, danceable arrangements that lost none of their jazz sophistication.
