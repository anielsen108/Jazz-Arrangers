# Bill Challis (1904-1994)

## Biography

William H. Challis was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and studied piano and composition. He joined Paul Whiteman's orchestra in 1927 as an arranger, where he created sophisticated arrangements that bridged jazz and classical music. Challis arranged for Whiteman's legendary band until 1930, working with soloists including Bix Beiderbecke, whose poetic cornet style influenced Challis's impressionistic arranging approach. After leaving Whiteman, Challis continued arranging for various bands but gradually withdrew from the music business, working in the defense industry. He remained retired from music for decades before making a comeback in the 1980s, when his contributions were finally recognized.

## Musical Style

Challis's arranging style was remarkably sophisticated for the 1920s, incorporating impressionistic harmonies, unusual instrumental combinations, and through-composed forms that went beyond typical jazz arrangements. He had studied Debussy and Ravel, and his work reflected their influence with whole-tone scales, parallel chord movement, and coloristic orchestration. Challis had a special gift for creating arrangements that showcased Bix Beiderbecke's lyrical cornet style, writing backgrounds that enhanced Beiderbecke's melodic improvisations. His arrangements often featured unexpected instrumental doublings and unusual textures. Unlike many jazz arrangers who focused primarily on rhythm and swing, Challis was equally concerned with harmony, tone color, and form. His work anticipated the cool jazz movement by two decades.

## Top Albums

### Paul Whiteman Orchestra featuring Bix Beiderbecke - "The Bix Beiderbecke Story, Vol. 3" (1927-1930)
This collection features Challis's most important arrangements, including "Changes," "San," and "Dardanella." What makes these arrangements remarkable is their sophistication—Challis created complex, through-composed pieces that worked as compositions in their own right while featuring Beiderbecke's sublime solos. "Changes" in particular showcases Challis's impressionistic approach with its unusual chord progressions and coloristic voicings. These arrangements sounded completely unlike anything else in 1920s jazz, presaging developments that wouldn't become common until decades later. The chemistry between Challis's arrangements and Beiderbecke's playing represents one of jazz's great partnerships.

### Paul Whiteman Orchestra - "Whiteman Stomp" (1927-1928)
These recordings showcase Challis's range as an arranger, from impressionistic pieces to hot jazz numbers. His arrangement of "Lonely Melody" demonstrates his gift for lush, romantic orchestration, while "Mississippi Mud" shows he could write swinging, accessible charts. What's fascinating is how Challis maintained his sophisticated harmonic approach even in commercial arrangements—he snuck advanced harmonies into ostensibly simple pop songs. The arrangements demonstrate why Whiteman's orchestra was considered the most musically advanced jazz orchestra of its era.

### Bill Challis - "The Goldkette Project" (1985)
After decades away from music, Challis returned to recreate and conduct arrangements from his youth, including his classic charts for Jean Goldkette's orchestra and Whiteman. What makes this album particularly valuable is hearing the elderly Challis directing modern musicians in his arrangements, explaining his intentions and approach. The recordings confirm that his advanced harmonies and unusual orchestrations were intentional, not accidents of recording. The album demonstrates that Challis's arranging concepts from the 1920s remained fresh and sophisticated sixty years later.
