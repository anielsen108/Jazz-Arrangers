# Edgar Sampson (1907-1973)

## Biography

Edgar Melvin Sampson was born in New York City and studied violin and saxophone. He played alto saxophone with Duke Ellington briefly before joining Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in 1931. His most significant association was with Chick Webb's orchestra (1933-1936), where his arrangements helped make Webb's band the terror of Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. Sampson composed and arranged many standards including "Stompin' at the Savoy," "Don't Be That Way," and "Blue Lou." Though less celebrated than some contemporaries, his compositions and arrangements were performed by virtually every swing band. He continued working as an arranger and led his own groups intermittently until the early 1970s.

## Musical Style

Sampson's arranging style was characterized by infectious swing feel, memorable melodic lines, and perfectly crafted riffs that became the basis for countless arrangements by others. He had an intuitive understanding of what made dancers move, and his arrangements had an irresistible propulsive quality. Sampson's reed section writing was particularly distinctive—he created thick, rich voicings that gave saxophones a powerful, unified voice. His arrangements typically featured strong opening statements followed by building intensity through repetition and variation of simple motifs. He excelled at writing arrangements that gave each section of the band memorable material while maintaining overall unity. Sampson's greatest gift was his ability to compose original material that sounded like standards—his melodies had an inevitability that made them seem like they'd always existed.

This collection features Sampson's most influential arrangements for Webb's legendary band, including his own compositions "Stompin' at the Savoy," "Blue Lou," and "Don't Be That Way."

While these aren't Sampson's arrangements, they feature his compositions "Stompin' at the Savoy," "Don't Be That Way," and "Blue Lou" played by Goodman's band. What's fascinating is hearing how Sampson's melodic genius translated across different arrangements—these tunes worked equally well in small group and big band settings. The compositions' strong melodic content and logical chord progressions made them ideal vehicles for improvisation, demonstrating why Sampson's tunes became standards while many of his contemporaries' work was forgotten.

Leading his own orchestra in the 1950s, Sampson revisited his classic arrangements while creating new ones. What makes this album valuable is hearing the arranger himself direct the performances—his choices of tempo, dynamics, and phrasing reveal his original intentions. The album demonstrates that Sampson's arranging concepts remained vital in the 1950s, though swing had fallen from commercial favor. His new arrangements show stylistic evolution while maintaining his gift for creating infectious, danceable swing.
