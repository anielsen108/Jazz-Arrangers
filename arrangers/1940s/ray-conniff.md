# Ray Conniff (1916-2002)

## Biography

Joseph Raymond Conniff was born in Massachusetts and played trombone before focusing on arranging. He arranged for Artie Shaw, Bob Crosby, and others in the 1940s before joining Columbia Records as arranger in the 1950s. Conniff developed a distinctive style featuring wordless vocals singing in harmony with instrumental sections, achieving massive commercial success. While primarily known for easy listening arrangements, Conniff's jazz arranging in the 1940s was sophisticated and swinging. He became one of the world's best-selling recording artists through his unique approach to popular music arrangement. Conniff's work demonstrated that jazz arranging skills could translate to enormous commercial success.

## Musical Style

Conniff's 1940s arranging style was sophisticated swing with excellent section writing and clear structures. His arrangements featured strong melodic lines supported by well-crafted harmonies. Conniff had a gift for creating smooth, professional arrangements that swung without being aggressive. His section writing, particularly for reeds, was exemplary—clear, balanced, and idiomatic. Conniff understood how to create arrangements that satisfied both dancers and listeners, maintaining musical interest without becoming too complex. His later signature style (vocals doubling instruments) wasn't present in his 1940s jazz work, which was straightforward sophisticated swing arranging. Conniff's jazz arrangements demonstrated excellent craftsmanship and professional polish, representing mainstream swing arranging at high levels.
