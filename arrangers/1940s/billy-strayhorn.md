# Billy Strayhorn (1915-1967)

## Biography

William Thomas "Billy" Strayhorn was born in Dayton, Ohio, and grew up in Pittsburgh. A classically trained pianist and composer, Strayhorn met Duke Ellington in 1938 and joined his organization shortly after. For the next 28 years until his death from esophageal cancer, Strayhorn was Ellington's closest collaborator, composing and arranging hundreds of pieces for the orchestra. Their collaboration was so close that distinguishing their individual contributions is often impossible. Strayhorn composed standards including "Take the 'A' Train," "Lush Life," and "Chelsea Bridge." Despite being openly gay in an intolerant era, Strayhorn maintained his dignity and integrity. His death in 1967 devastated Ellington, who created the memorial album "...And His Mother Called Him Bill."

## Musical Style

Strayhorn's arranging style was characterized by lush, impressionistic harmonies influenced by Debussy, Ravel, and Ellington himself. He had a particular gift for delicate, introspective pieces with complex harmonic structures. Strayhorn's voicings were often more vertical and orchestral than Ellington's, though their styles became so intertwined that distinction is difficult. He excelled at writing for small groups within the orchestra, creating chamber-like intimacy within big band contexts. Strayhorn had a remarkably sophisticated harmonic palette, using chromaticism, whole-tone scales, and unexpected modulations. His ballad writing was particularly sublime, creating emotional depth through harmonic movement. Unlike some arrangers who imposed similar approaches on every piece, Strayhorn's arrangements were custom-tailored to each composition's specific needs. His orchestrations revealed Ellington's band members' most lyrical qualities.

## Top Albums

### Duke Ellington Orchestra - "...And His Mother Called Him Bill" (1967)
Recorded shortly after Strayhorn's death, this album features Ellington performing Strayhorn compositions and arrangements as a memorial. Pieces like "Blood Count" (Strayhorn's final composition), "Lotus Blossom," and "Rain Check" showcase his most personal, harmonically adventurous writing. What makes this album particularly poignant is hearing how perfectly Strayhorn understood the Ellington orchestra—every arrangement brings out the specific voices he worked with for nearly three decades. The album reveals Strayhorn's individual voice separate from Ellington, showing his distinct approach was more introspective and impressionistic. Ellington's solo piano coda on "Lotus Blossom" is one of jazz's most moving moments.

### Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn - "The Far East Suite" (1966)
Co-composed and arranged by Ellington and Strayhorn after a State Department tour, this suite represents their collaboration at its peak. Strayhorn's arrangements on pieces like "Isfahan" and "Bluebird of Delhi" demonstrate his gift for creating exotic atmospheres through orchestration. What's fascinating is how Strayhorn incorporated Middle Eastern and Asian influences while maintaining jazz authenticity—his approach was to filter these influences through his harmonic language rather than copying surface elements. The arrangements showcase individual orchestra members in featured roles, demonstrating Strayhorn's intimate knowledge of each player's strengths.

### Billy Strayhorn - "The Peaceful Side" (1961)
One of the rare albums featuring Strayhorn's own small group, this showcases his arranging for quintet/sextet. His arrangements of "Passion Flower," "Chelsea Bridge," and "A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing" reveal his compositional genius and his ability to create lush soundscapes with minimal forces. What's particularly interesting is hearing Strayhorn's piano playing, which reveals the harmonic thinking behind his arrangements. The album demonstrates that his arranging gifts weren't dependent on the Ellington orchestra's resources—he could create beauty in any format.
