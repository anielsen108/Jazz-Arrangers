# Johnny Mandel (1925-2020)

## Biography

John Alfred Mandel was born in New York City and studied trumpet and trombone at Juilliard. He played trombone with several big bands including those of Joe Venuti, Jimmy Dorsey, Buddy Rich, and Woody Herman before focusing on arranging. Mandel wrote for Count Basie, Artie Shaw, and others before moving to California in the 1950s to work in film and television. He composed and arranged music for numerous films including "The Sandpiper" (featuring his song "The Shadow of Your Smile"), "M*A*S*H" (the theme), and "Being There." Mandel was equally successful in jazz and popular music contexts, remaining active into his 90s.

## Musical Style

Mandel's arranging style was characterized by elegance, sophistication, and impeccable taste. His voicings were rich and colorful, incorporating elements from both jazz and classical orchestration. Mandel had a particular gift for writing lush, romantic ballad arrangements with complex inner voices. His approach emphasized melody and harmony over flashy effects. He was masterful at creating arrangements that supported without overwhelming, perfect for featuring singers or soloists. Mandel's use of woodwinds was particularly sophisticated, often featuring flutes, oboe, and bass clarinet in unusual combinations. His harmonic language incorporated impressionistic elements while remaining accessible. Mandel's arrangements had a timeless quality—they sounded modern in any era because they focused on fundamental musical values rather than stylistic trends.
