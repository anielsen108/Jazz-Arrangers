# Billy May (1916-2004)

## Biography

Edward William "Billy" May Jr. was born in Pittsburgh and studied at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He played trumpet and arranged for the Glenn Miller Orchestra before moving to California to work as a freelance arranger and conductor. May became one of the most sought-after arrangers in popular music, creating definitive arrangements for Frank Sinatra ("Come Fly with Me," "Come Swing with Me"), Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, and others. His work for Capitol Records helped define the label's sound. May also worked extensively in television and film, scoring numerous productions. He continued arranging and conducting into his 80s.

## Musical Style

May's arranging style was characterized by crisp, swinging brass sections, often featuring his trademark "slurping" saxophones—a sliding effect between notes. His arrangements were bold, energetic, and immediately identifiable. May had a gift for creating exciting introductions that grabbed listeners immediately. His style was more extroverted and showy than subtle, perfect for making records that jumped out of jukeboxes and radios. May's brass writing was particularly powerful, creating massive ensemble sounds without losing clarity. He understood how to arrange for singers, supporting them without overshadowing while maintaining musical interest. His transitions between sections were smooth and logical. May's commercial success sometimes obscured his jazz chops—his swing credentials were impeccable and his arrangements always grooved hard.
