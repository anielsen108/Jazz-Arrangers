# Eddie Sauter (1914-1981)

## Biography

Edward Ernest Sauter was born in Brooklyn and studied music at Columbia University and Juilliard. He arranged for Red Norvo's band in the mid-1930s before joining Benny Goodman's orchestra in 1939, where his sophisticated arrangements contrasted with and complemented Fletcher Henderson's work. Sauter arranged for Artie Shaw and others before partnering with Bill Finegan to form the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra (1952-1958), which featured elaborately arranged, often humorous orchestral jazz. After the partnership dissolved, Sauter continued arranging and led the WDR Radio Orchestra in Germany in the 1960s. He remained active until his death.

## Musical Style

Sauter's arranging style was adventurous, harmonically sophisticated, and often experimental. He incorporated unusual instrumental combinations, unexpected dissonances, and sophisticated classical techniques into jazz contexts. Sauter's arrangements often featured dramatic dynamic contrasts and surprising formal structures. He wasn't afraid of complexity and sometimes created arrangements that challenged both musicians and listeners. Sauter had a particular gift for writing for clarinet, creating intricate passages that showcased the instrument's capabilities. His voicings were often unusual, using instrumental registers in unexpected ways. The Sauter-Finegan Orchestra showcased his most extreme tendencies—elaborate orchestrations with sound effects, unusual instruments, and programmatic elements. Despite these adventurous qualities, Sauter's arrangements always maintained swing feeling and emotional impact.

## Top Albums

### Benny Goodman Orchestra - "The Yale Archives, Vol. 1" (1939-1940, Sauter arrangements)
Sauter's arrangements for Goodman including "Benny Rides Again" and "Clarinet à la King" demonstrate his sophisticated approach. "Clarinet à la King" particularly showcases Sauter's gift for writing elaborate, quasi-classical passages for Goodman's clarinet with orchestra. What makes these arrangements remarkable is their harmonic adventurousness—Sauter used dissonances and unusual progressions that pushed swing's boundaries. His arrangements often featured extensive introductions and codas that were as important as the main body. These charts show that swing could be intellectually challenging while remaining exciting and danceable.

### Sauter-Finegan Orchestra - "New Directions in Music" (1953)
This album showcases Sauter-Finegan's unique approach—elaborate orchestral arrangements with unusual instruments, sound effects, and programmatic elements. "Doodletown Fifers" features piccolos, "Midnight Sleighride" incorporates sleigh bells and winter atmosphere. What makes this album fascinating is how Sauter and Finegan created arrangements that worked as entertainment while maintaining musical sophistication. The orchestrations are remarkably detailed with constant textural variety. While sometimes dismissed as gimmicky, these arrangements represented serious experiments in expanding jazz arranging's possibilities. The album influenced both jazz and commercial music arranging.
