His style incorporated elements from various sources—Spanish and Latin American music, the blues, modernist classical music—synthesized into a distinctive voice. Wilson's arrangements featured strong melodies and clear formal structures. He was particularly skilled at building intensity through repetition and variation of motifs. His voicings were rich and dense, creating massive ensemble sounds. Wilson's arrangements demanded technical excellence from musicians while remaining emotionally direct.
