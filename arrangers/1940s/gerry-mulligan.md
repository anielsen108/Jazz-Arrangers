# Gerry Mulligan (1927-1996)

## Biography

Gerald Joseph Mulligan was born in Queens, New York, and started arranging as a teenager. He arranged for Gene Krupa and Claude Thornhill before becoming a key figure in the Miles Davis Birth of the Cool project (1949-1950), where his arrangements helped define cool jazz. Mulligan moved to California in the early 1950s and formed his famous pianoless quartet with Chet Baker, revolutionizing small group jazz. He continued leading various ensembles, from quartets to big bands, while composing and arranging prolifically. Mulligan's baritone saxophone playing made him one of jazz's most recognizable voices. He remained active until his death from complications of knee surgery.

## Musical Style

Mulligan's arranging style emphasized linear counterpoint over vertical harmony, creating arrangements where multiple melodic lines interweaved. His Birth of the Cool charts demonstrated his gift for creating complex textures with modest forces. Mulligan favored transparency and lightness over power and density. His arrangements often featured walking bass lines and contrapuntal writing that created motion without relying on traditional chord progressions. He had a particular gift for writing for brass instruments, understanding their tonal qualities from his own playing. Mulligan's style incorporated elements of baroque counterpoint within jazz contexts. His arrangements were sophisticated yet accessible, intellectual yet swinging. He preferred understatement to bombast, creating arrangements that revealed more with repeated listening.

## Top Albums

### Miles Davis - "Birth of the Cool" (1949-1950, Mulligan arrangements)
Mulligan's arrangements including "Jeru," "Venus de Milo," and "Rocker" helped define cool jazz. What makes these arrangements revolutionary is their approach—instead of hot, aggressive swing, Mulligan created cool, sophisticated counterpoint. His arrangement of "Venus de Milo" demonstrates his gift for creating multiple melodic lines that work together creating harmonic movement. The arrangements use the nonet's unusual instrumentation (trumpet, trombone, French horn, tuba, saxophone, and rhythm) to create chamber-like textures. These charts influenced West Coast jazz and countless arrangers seeking alternatives to bebop's intensity.

### Gerry Mulligan Concert Jazz Band - "The Gerry Mulligan Concert Jazz Band" (1960)
Mulligan's arrangements for his own big band represent his mature style. "Blueport" and "Mainstreet" showcase his contrapuntal approach applied to large ensemble. What's particularly notable is how Mulligan creates fullness through linear writing rather than vertical chord voicings. The arrangements feature constant motion with walking lines and interweaving melodies. Mulligan's baritone is featured but integrated into the ensemble rather than separated as soloist over accompaniment. The album demonstrates that Mulligan's cool jazz concepts worked in big band contexts.

### Gerry Mulligan meets Ben Webster - "Gerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster" (1959)
While primarily a blowing session, this album includes Mulligan's arrangement concepts applied in real-time. His approach to accompaniment—creating countermelodies and alternative harmonies—is evident throughout. What makes this album interesting from an arranging perspective is hearing Mulligan's linear thinking in a spontaneous context. His comping behind Webster creates additional melodic interest rather than simple chord accompaniment. The session demonstrates that Mulligan's arranging philosophy informed his playing—he was always thinking contrapuntally.
