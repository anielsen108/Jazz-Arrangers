# Ralph Burns (1922-2001)

## Biography

Ralph Joseph P. Burns was born in Newton, Massachusetts, and studied at the New England Conservatory. He joined Woody Herman's First Herd as a pianist in 1944 and became the band's chief arranger, creating some of the era's most progressive jazz arrangements. Burns wrote "Early Autumn," which launched Stan Getz's career, and the extended composition "Summer Sequence." After Herman's band, Burns worked extensively in New York studios and later moved to Los Angeles for film and television work. He arranged for countless singers and won Tony Awards for Broadway work on "Chicago" and "Cabaret." Burns successfully bridged jazz, theater, and film worlds.

## Musical Style

Burns's arranging style evolved from bebop-influenced progressive jazz in the 1940s to sophisticated studio arranging in later decades. His early work featured advanced harmonies, complex counterpoint, and ambitious extended forms. Burns had a gift for writing arrangements that were intellectually sophisticated yet emotionally engaging. His voicings were lush and full, often featuring thick ensemble passages. He was particularly skilled at writing for saxophone sections, creating rich harmonies that influenced generations of arrangers. Burns's arrangements balanced composition and improvisation perfectly, giving soloists exciting frameworks. His extended works like "Summer Sequence" demonstrated that jazz could sustain longer forms. Later in his career, Burns's style became more eclectic, incorporating various popular music elements while maintaining jazz foundations.

## Top Albums

### Woody Herman - "The Thundering Herds" (1945-1947)
Burns's arrangements for Herman's First Herd including "Apple Honey," "Bijou," and "Early Autumn" represent progressive jazz at its finest. "Early Autumn" particularly demonstrates Burns's gift for creating romantic, harmonically sophisticated ballad arrangements. What makes these arrangements remarkable is how they balance complexity with accessibility—they're intellectually challenging but emotionally direct. Burns's use of woodwinds doubling gives the band a distinctive color, and his counterpoint between sections creates constant interest. "Summer Sequence" (four parts) demonstrated Burns could sustain longer forms with continuously fresh ideas.

### Woody Herman - "The Second Herd" (1948-1950)
Burns continued arranging for Herman's Second Herd (the "Four Brothers" band), adapting to the new personnel. His arrangement of "That's Right" showcases the famous sax section playing in close harmony. What's interesting is how Burns evolved his style for the new band while maintaining his identity. These arrangements are slightly cooler and more refined than the First Herd's hot style. Burns's writing for the saxophone section here influenced every jazz arranger who followed—the "Four Brothers" sound became a template.

### Stan Getz - "Focus" (1961)
Burns wrote extended arrangements featuring Getz with string orchestra, creating one of jazz's most successful fusions of jazz improvisation and classical orchestration. The arrangements provide sophisticated harmonic frameworks for Getz's improvisation while working as compositions in their own right. What makes this album remarkable is how Burns creates genuine dialogue between soloist and orchestra—Getz isn't accompanied but integrated. The arrangements are through-composed rather than based on repeated forms, showing Burns's compositional ambition. This album influenced countless attempts to feature jazz soloists with strings.
