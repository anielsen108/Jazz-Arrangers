## Biography

Willis Leonard Holman was born in Olive, California, and studied engineering at UCLA before pursuing music full-time. He played tenor saxophone with Charlie Barnet and Stan Kenton while developing his arranging skills. Holman became one of the most respected West Coast jazz arrangers, writing for Kenton, Buddy Rich, Gerry Mulligan, and countless others. He has led his own Grammy-winning big band since the 1970s. Holman received NEA Jazz Master honors and continues arranging in his 90s, one of the living links to the cool jazz era.

## Musical Style

Holman's arranging style is characterized by sophisticated counterpoint, witty musical quotes, and remarkable craftsmanship. His arrangements often feature multiple melodic lines occurring simultaneously, creating rich contrapuntal textures. Holman has a playful sense of humor, often incorporating musical jokes and clever references. His voicings are clear and transparent, never muddied despite complexity. Holman excels at development—taking a simple motif and exploring its possibilities throughout an arrangement. His writing is always swinging yet intellectually engaging. He treats all sections of the band with equal importance, writing interesting parts for everyone. Holman's style has remained remarkably consistent—his recent arrangements sound unmistakably like his 1950s work while incorporating modern elements.

## Top Albums

### Stan Kenton - "Kenton Showcase" (1954)
Holman's arrangements for Kenton including "Stella by Starlight" and "Kingfish" demonstrate his emergence as a major arranger. What makes these charts notable is how Holman brought a lighter, more contrapuntal approach to Kenton's often bombastic band. His arrangement of "Stella by Starlight" is a masterclass in sophisticated big band writing with multiple independent voices weaving together. The arrangements show Holman's classical training integrated into jazz contexts without sounding academic.

### Bill Holman Big Band - "A View from the Side" (1995)
Leading his own Grammy-winning band, Holman's arrangements showcase his mature style. "The Monk" and original compositions demonstrate his continued evolution. What's remarkable is how fresh these arrangements sound—Holman's approach remained modern decades after his emergence. His contrapuntal writing is as sophisticated as ever, and his wit is evident throughout. The album demonstrates that sophisticated big band arranging remained vital in the 1990s.

### Buddy Rich Big Band - "Swingin' New Big Band" (1966, Holman arrangements)
Holman's arrangements for Rich's band had to satisfy the drummer's demand for excitement while maintaining sophistication. Charts like "Channel One Suite" demonstrate Holman's gift for creating dense contrapuntal passages that nonetheless swing hard. What's particularly impressive is how Holman writes arrangements that feature Rich's drumming prominently while maintaining complete musical interest. These arrangements influenced modern big band writing.
