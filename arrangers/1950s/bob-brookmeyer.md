# Bob Brookmeyer (1929-2011)

## Biography

Robert Edward "Bob" Brookmeyer was born in Kansas City and played piano before switching to valve trombone, becoming one of the few masters of that instrument in jazz. He worked with Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, and the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra while developing as an arranger. Brookmeyer's later career focused increasingly on composing and arranging, writing extended works for orchestras worldwide. He taught at several institutions including the New England Conservatory. Brookmeyer received numerous awards and continued creating innovative arrangements until his death from heart failure.

## Musical Style

Brookmeyer's arranging style evolved from West Coast cool jazz in the 1950s to sophisticated modernism in later decades. His early arrangements emphasized counterpoint and transparency, featuring the linear thinking of cool jazz. Brookmeyer's mature style incorporated advanced harmonies, complex formal structures, and through-composed development. He thought orchestrally, using the full palette of instrumental colors with chamber-like precision. Brookmeyer's arrangements balanced intellectual rigor with emotional expression—they were sophisticated without being cold. His later work abandoned conventional jazz forms entirely, creating through-composed pieces that worked as serious compositions. Brookmeyer's style represented the highest level of jazz compositional craft, treating big band as medium for sophisticated musical thought.
