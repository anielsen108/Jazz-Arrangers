# Benny Golson (b. 1929)

## Biography

Benny Golson was born in Philadelphia and grew up immersed in that city's rich jazz tradition. He studied at Howard University before beginning his professional career with Bull Moose Jackson's R&B band. Golson played tenor saxophone with Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, and others while establishing himself as one of hard bop's premier composers. His compositions "I Remember Clifford" (a tribute to Clifford Brown), "Killer Joe," "Along Came Betty," and "Whisper Not" became jazz standards. In 1959, Golson co-founded The Jazztet with Art Farmer, creating sophisticated small group arrangements. He later moved to Los Angeles for film and television work before returning to active jazz performance. Now in his 90s, Golson remains an elder statesman of jazz.

His arrangements feature clear structures that balance composition and improvisation perfectly.

Golson's style emphasized melody and form, creating arrangements that worked as compositions while providing excellent frameworks for improvisation. His voicings were warm and full, influenced by his experience as a saxophonist. Golson's work represented hard bop arranging at its finest—sophisticated yet soulful, complex yet accessible.
