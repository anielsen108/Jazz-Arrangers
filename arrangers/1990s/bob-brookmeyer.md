# Bob Brookmeyer (1929-2011)

Brookmeyer's later period (1990s-2000s) produced his most sophisticated arrangements. His work with the New Art Orchestra and various European bands demonstrated his evolution toward through-composed modernism. Brookmeyer abandoned conventional jazz forms, creating complex compositions that maintained improvisation elements. His mature style influenced contemporary large ensemble composition significantly, demonstrating that jazz could sustain serious compositional ambition.
